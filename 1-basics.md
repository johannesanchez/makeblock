Knowing mblock

1. Getting around mblock
2. Block Reference: https://support.makeblock.com/hc/en-us/articles/12738783754903-Block-Reference
3. Python Reference:


Step 1. Setup the Mbot2 Robot
    - Assemble the Mbot2 torobt and connect it to you computer using a USB cable.
    - Install the necessary drivers and software for programming the MBot2

Step 2. Install the Necessary Libraries and Packages
    - Install the necessary libraries and packages for pogramming the Mbot2 in Python, such as the Pyserial library and the MBot2 Python API.

Step 3. Program the Robot to Detect the Line
    - Use the MBot2's line follower sensor to detect the line on the ground
    - Write Python code to read the sensor data and dtermine the robot's position relative to the line

Step 4. Program the Robot to Follow the Line
    - Write Pythin code to control the robot's motors and steer it along the line.
    - Implement algorthms such as PID control to imrpove the robot's line-following performance.

Step 5. Test and Refine the Robot's Performance
    - Experiment with different line-following strategies and algorithms to see how they affect the robot's    performance.
